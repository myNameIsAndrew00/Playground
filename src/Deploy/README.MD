# Deploy
Files in this directory can be used to generates de executables and libraries automatically. 

>Run `Build.bat` to generate the platform service executable and pkcs11 C library.

>Run `Install.bat` to install the platform service. Requires deploy directory which is generated by  `Build.bat` 

>Run `Unistall.bat` to unistall the platform service.

# Setup
For now, platform requires **Windows OS** as host for building and runing. To build the  service, **.NET 5 SDK tools** are required to be installed on the development machine. **.NET 5 runtime** is required to be installed on service server machine, for runing the PKCS11 service.

To build the client library, **Microsoft Visual C++** (MSVC) is required to be installed.
